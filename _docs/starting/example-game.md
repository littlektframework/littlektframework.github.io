As a starting point, we can check out the [samples](https://github.com/littlektframework/littlekt-samples) repository which contains a few resources on how we can structure our code and few examples on using LittleKt.

## Flappy Bird Clone

The samples repo also contains a [Flappy Bird clone](https://github.com/littlektframework/littlekt-samples/blob/master/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/littlekt/samples/flappybird/FlappyBird.kt). This is a very simple game which showcases a little bit of everything that can be done in **LittleKt**.

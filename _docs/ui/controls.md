A [Control](https://github.com/littlektframework/littlekt/blob/master/core/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/littlekt/graph/node/node2d/ui/Control.kt) is the base node that all UI related nodes are inherited from. The `Control` node handles all the functionality for updating anchors, margins, and sizes based on its parent control or the viewport. For more information on how anchors and sizes work check out the [Size and Anchors](/docs/ui/size-and-anchors) page.

## Using a Control

Every `Control` comes with its own builder method to be used within a [SceneGraph](/docs/scene-graph/the-scene-graph) or `Node` scope. They generally use the name of the node class in lowercase form. The method also accepts a callback lambda that can be used to initialize and implement that functionality of the control.

```kotlin
button {
    text = "Hello!"
}
```

### Input

The `SceneGraph` manages the input and passing down input events through scene's root. Input events, such as, hovering with a mouse or focusing with a keyboard, are forwarded through the graph until a `Control` node marks the event as handled in the `uiInput(InputEvent)` method.

Only one `Control` can have keyboard focus at a time. When a `Control` receives or loses keyboard focus, the `onFocus` and `onFocusLost` callbacks are invoked to handle the event. To request focus of a `Control` we can call the `grabFocus()` method.

### Theme

When a theme is set on a `Control` node, it affects all of its children. To override some of the theme values, use one of the `_override` maps defined in the `Control` class. See [Themes](/docs/ui/themes) for more information on how to use themes.

## Types of Controls

The following list will only include non-container controls. For a list of containers, check out the [container types](/docs/ui/containers#container-types).

### Base Control

The base control (via [Control](https://github.com/littlektframework/littlekt/blob/master/core/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/littlekt/graph/node/node2d/ui/Control.kt)). Contains no renderable components.

```kotlin
control {
    name = "GUI"
}
```

### Button

A standard themed button (via [Button](https://github.com/littlektframework/littlekt/blob/master/core/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/littlekt/graph/node/node2d/ui/Button.kt)) that can contain text and is displayed according to the `Theme`.

```kotlin
button {
    text = "Click me!"

    onPressed += {
        log.info { "I was pressed!" }
    }
}
```

### Label

Displays plain text (via [Label](https://github.com/littlektframework/littlekt/blob/master/core/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/littlekt/graph/node/node2d/ui/Label.kt)). Allows control of the horizontal and vertical alignments.

```kotlin
label {
    text = "My label"
    horizontalAlign = HAlign.CENTER
    verticalAlign = VAlign.CENTER
}
```

### LineEdit

Renders and a single line of editable text (via [LineEdit](https://github.com/littlektframework/littlekt/blob/master/core/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/littlekt/graph/node/node2d/ui/LineEdit.kt)).

Contains commonly built in shortcuts:

-   **Ctrl + C**: Copy
-   **Ctrl + X**: Cut
-   **Ctrl + V**: Paste
-   **Ctrl + Z** : Undo
-   **Ctrl + Shift + Z**: Redo
-   **Ctrl + A**: Select all

```kotlin
lineEdit {
    placeholderText = "Enter your username"
}

lineEdit {
    placeholderText = "Enter your password"
    secretCharacter = '-'
    secret = true // will render the text as a '-' instead of the default '*'
}
```

### NinePatchRect

Creates a ninepatch by slicing up the texture into nine patches (via [NinePatchRect](https://github.com/littlektframework/littlekt/blob/master/core/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/littlekt/graph/node/node2d/ui/NinePatchRect.kt)) which produces clean panels of any size, based on a small texture by splitting it into a 3x3 grid. The drawn, the texture tiles the textures sides horizontally or vertically and the center on both axes but doesn't scale or tile the corners.

```kotlin
ninePatchRect {
    texture = myTextureSlice
    left = 3
    right = 3
    top = 3
    bottom = 3
}
```

### Panel

Displays an opaque background (via [Panel](https://github.com/littlektframework/littlekt/blob/master/core/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/littlekt/graph/node/node2d/ui/Panel.kt)). Commonly used as a parent.

```kotlin
panel {
    label {
        text = "Hello! I have an opaque background!"
    }
}
```

### ProgressBar

Generic progress bar / slider (via [ProgressBar](https://github.com/littlektframework/littlekt/blob/master/core/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/littlekt/graph/node/node2d/ui/ProgressBar.kt)) that shows the fill percentage from left to right.

```kotlin
progressBar {
    value = 50f // or we can do 'ratio = 0.5f'
}
```

### TextureProgress

A textured-based progress bar (via [TextureProgress](https://github.com/littlektframework/littlekt/blob/master/core/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/littlekt/graph/node/node2d/ui/TextureProgress.kt)). Useful for loading screens and health bars.

```kotlin
textureProgress {
    background = atlas.getByPrefix("healthBarBg").slice
    progressBar = atlas.getByPrefix("healthBarProgress").slice
    foreground = atlas.getByPrefix("healthBarFg").slice

    value = 100
}
```

### TextureRect

Draws a texture slice (via [TextureRect](https://github.com/littlektframework/littlekt/blob/master/core/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/littlekt/graph/node/node2d/ui/TextureRect.kt)). It can scale, tile, and keep centered inside its bounding box.

```kotlin
textureRect {
    slice = myTextureSlice
    stretchMode = TextureRect.StretchMode.TILE

    // this is false by default. Useful for positiong the TextureSlice based off the oringal size before packing and trimming.
    useOriginalSize = true
}
```

### ScrollBar

An abstract `Range`-based `Control` that displays a draggable area (`page`) (via [ScrollBar](https://github.com/littlektframework/littlekt/blob/master/core/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/littlekt/graph/node/ui/ScrollBar.kt)). See [HScrollBar](https://github.com/littlektframework/littlekt/blob/master/core/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/littlekt/graph/node/ui/HScrollBar.kt) or [VScrollBar](https://github.com/littlektframework/littlekt/blob/master/core/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/littlekt/graph/node/ui/VScrollBar.kt) in order to use it.

```kotlin
vScrollBar {
    page = 10f
    height = 100f
}
hScrollBar {
    page = 10f
    width = 100f
}
```

## Custom Control

For something not available out of the box, we can go about creating our own implementation by extending a `Control`. There are a few things we need to ensure we do in order for it to be used properly by parent containers and such.

### Calculating Size

Override the `calclateMinSize()` method from `Control`. This is where we should place our calculations for determining the minimum size that a control should be. How that is calculated is up to you. For example, the below code is calculating the minimum size by taking the bigger value of the background drawable size or the specified `minWidth` / `minHeight` properties.

We need to ensure we set the `_internalMinWidth` and `_internalMinHeight` properties of the control. Notice the underscore `_`. Do not set the properties internal size properties that do not start with an underscore. Doing so will cause an infinite loop of minimum-size calculations.

```kotlin
override fun calculateMinSize() {
    // we should ensure we check minSizeInvalid is false then we don't want to recaculate
    // doing so will just waste resources
    if (!minSizeInvalid) return

    _internalMinWidth = max(minWidth, bg.minWidth)
    _internalMinHeight = max(minHeight, bg.minHeight)

    // ensure we set minSizeInvalid to false after we finish calculating.
    minSizeInvalid = false
}
```

### Handling Input Events

Overriding the `uiInput()` method allows the `Control` to view any input events that make it through the graph to the node. The `InputEvent` contains information on what type of event has occurred, and what invoked the event (key, pointer, movement, etc). We can then mark the event as handled if we want to ensure that the event doesn't propagate down to any other controls.

```kotlin
override fun uiInput(event: InputEvent<*>) {
    super.uiInput(event)

    if (event.type == InputEvent.Type.TOUCH_DOWN) {
        // handle touching / mouse click
    }

    if (event.type == InputEvent.Type.KEY_DOWN) {
        if(event.key == Key.SPACE) {
            // handle key event
            event.handle() // marks the event as handled.
        }
    }
}
```

We can also handle focus events via `onFocus()` and `onFocusLost()`:

```kotlin
override fun onFocus() {
    // handle focus
}

override fun onFocusLost() {
    // focus lost
}
```

### Rendering

In order to render a `Control` we have access to the `render()` method that we can override. The method is provided with a `Batch` instance that we can use to draw any textures and such to the screen as well as the scene's `Camera` instance.

```kotlin
override fun render(batch: Batch, camera: Camera) {
    super.render(batch, camera)
    batch.draw(
        textureSlice,
        x = globalX,
        y = globalY,
        scaleX = globalScaleX,
        scaleY = globalScaleY,
        rotation = globalRotation,
        colorBits = color.toFloatBits()
    )
}
```

## Debugging

### Debug Render

The scene graph contains a flag `showDebugInfo` that is set to `false` by default. Setting this to `true` will allow the `CanvasLayer` to call the interal debug render method to allow propagation through the tree. This will ultimately invoke the `debugRender` method in a node.

A `Control` node, by default, overrides the `debugRender` and will render the bounds of the node. This is useful for helping with the positioning of the UI. We can override this method to provide our own debug rendering of any sort.
